# ESP-32-http-request-based-vehicle-controlling
A 3 wheeler(2 wheels powered) mini car would be controlled via http requests sent to esp32 from any device at same Wi-Fi network. Sending http requests manually is possible but won't be practical so I made a python code to send http requests from your desktop or laptop using your keyboard and gaming keys "W", "S", "A", "D".
